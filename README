This program is an implementation of the Lispkit described in the 
book "FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING: Application and Implementation", by
Peter Henderson, ISBN 0-13-331579-7.

If you have a C compiler and make, like gcc and gmake, you can
 build the program with:

  make

If compilation is successful, you can test lispkit - this will 
attempt some of the examples from table 12.1 and 12.2 in the book.

  make test

To compile a lispkit program, where [filename] is the name of 
a file containing lispkit source code:

  ./lispkit compiler.ascii [filename]

To compile one of the examples, examples/square.lisp:

  make examples/square.o

You should see some output like:

  ( 3 ( 1 ( 0 . 0 ) 1 ( 0 . 0 ) 17 5 ) 4 21 )

Then run it, with no second argument lispkit will read the input
from stdin.

  echo 5 | ./lispkit examples/square.o
  25
