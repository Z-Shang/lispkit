This program is an implementation of the Lispkit described in the 
book "FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING: Application and Implementation", by
Peter Henderson, ISBN 0-13-331579-7.

If you have a C compiler and make, like gcc and gmake, you can
 build the program with:

  make

To run lispkit, where [function] is the name of a file containing
lispkit source code:

  ./lispkit compiler.code [function]

There are some example functions in the tests directory, these
came from the tables 12.1 and 12.2 in the book. 

  ./lispkit compiler.code tests/lk-test-01
